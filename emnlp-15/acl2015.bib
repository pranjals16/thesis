  year={2014},
  annote = {
There is rising interest in vector-space word embeddings and their use in
NLP, especially given recent methods for their fast estimation at very large
scale. Nearly all this work, however, assumes a single vector per word
type—ignoring polysemy and thus jeopardizing their usefulness for downstream
tasks. We present an extension to the Skip-gram model that efficiently learns
multiple embeddings per word type. It differs from recent related work by
jointly performing word sense discrimination and embedding learning, by
non-parametrically estimating the number of senses per word type, and by its
ef- ficiency and scalability. We present new state-of-the-art results in the
word similarity in context task and demonstrate its scalability by training
with one machine on a corpus of nearly 1 billion tokens in less than 6
hours.
