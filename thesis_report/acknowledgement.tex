First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor, Dr. Amitabha Mukerjee, for his  constant support and encouragement. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice which gave a proper direction to my efforts. I am grateful to him for providing me ample freedom to choose a topic of my interest and deciding how to pursue it.

I thank the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur, for providing the necessary infrastructure and a congenial environment for research work. I thank Tomas Mikolov for making the code of word2vec and sentence2vec publicly available.

I am also thankful to all my friends and specially wingmates who have made my stay at IIT Kanpur most enjoyable and who in general gave me strength and hope whenever I required.
Last, but not the least, I thank my parents for always being there for me.
