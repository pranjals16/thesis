	We experimented on two Hindi review datasets. One is the Product Review dataset (LTG, IIIT Hyderabad) containing 350 Positive reviews and 350 Negative reviews. The other is a Movie Review dataset (CFILT, IIT Bombay) containing 127 Positive reviews and 125 Negative reviews. Similarly, for English, we trained on IMDB movie review dataset (Maas et al.(2013)) which consists of 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews.\\
	We also trained our skip-gram model on Hindi Wikipedia text dump (approx. 290MB) containing around 24M words with 724K words in the vocabulary. This provided us with good embeddings due to larger size and contents from almost all domains.
